Firstly, you will be acquainted with time series having an exogenous input, having to analyze the impulse response of such a system and from it build a suitable model. Secondly, we will examine how one can predict a time series, perhaps the most important application of time series modeling. You will be expected to make predictions of all models introduced in this course."

    "In this and in the next section, you will work with modeling of input-output relations, both using the ARMAX model and the transfer function model framework. As modeling of a signal which has an exogenous input (an input which is known, i.e., deterministic) is generally more complex than the common time series models encountered so far in this course, one must take care and proceed with caution. Often very simple models of a low order will suffice, while complex ones will only add variance, detrimental to the precision of predictions.\n",

    "When predicting ARMAX-processes, one needs to consider also the external input. We will now make use of an additional temperature measurement done at the airport Sturup. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) has made a 3-step predictions of the temperature for Sturup, which may be used as an external input signal to our temperature measurements in Svedala. (The provided signals are in sync, so the value at time $t$ in Sturup is the predicted value corresponding to that time. Thus, you do not need to shift the input.)\n",

Note that it is *only* in cases when the input cannot be predicted, i.e., when $x_t$ is a white process, that one omits the $\\hat{F}_k(z) \\hat{x}_{t+k|t}$ term from the prediction. Otherwise, when $x_t$ has any form of structure, it may be predicted, and then the term *should* be included. (To avoid making this error, it is recommended that you *always* include the term; when predicting $\\hat{x}_{t+k|t}$ in the (rare) white noise case, this will of course be zero, so you will just add a zero sequence, which will not corrupt your results, but then you will not forget to add it, which will certainly cause problematic results (this typically appears as predictions that seem to have the correct pattern, but with a too low amplitude).)\n",

However, to avoid the sequences to get out of sync with each other, one should remove the *same* number of samples from both sequences, so that one removes the maximum of the number of samples that are required to be removed from either sequence.\n",

Perhaps try some other term? Maybe you can get better results by adding a simple $A_2(z)$ polynomial? Can you remove some coefficients?
